# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms

## Overview: 
This project applies deep learning to breast cancer detection using MRI scans.   It evaluates  ResNet-50 v2, Vision Transformers (ViT), and Kolmogorovâ€“Arnold Networks (KAN) , and explores  Hybrid models (ResNet+KAN, ViT+KAN) to deliver accurate, interpretable, and scalable AI support for diagnosis.  

## Objectives :
Develop accurate deep learning models for medical image classification.
Compare different architectures (ResNet, ViT, KAN).
Explore fusion with KAN to enhance explainability and performance.

## Models Used:
ResNet-50: A powerful CNN-based model for feature extraction.
Vision Transformer (ViT): A transformer-based architecture for image classification.
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN): A novel spline-based model focusing on interpretability.
Hybrid Models (ResNet+KAN, ViT+KAN): To combine strengths of both paradigms.

## Results: 
ResNet-50 + KAN: 63% Accuracy
ViT + KAN: 93.10% Accuracy
Hybrid models improved interpretability and overall performance.
Graphs, confusion matrices, and comparison tables are available in the results/ folder.

## Dataset:
A dataset containing 1,480 MRI images of breast cancer patients, classified into two categories: "healthy" and "diseased" (benign and malignant), was used for testing. This dataset includes 40 images per category.
You can access the dataset via the following link:
