# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
This project applies deep learning to breast cancer detection using MRI scans.   It evaluates  ResNet-50 v2, Vision Transformers (ViT), and Kolmogorovâ€“Arnold Networks (KAN) , and explores  Hybrid models (ResNet+KAN, ViT+KAN) to deliver accurate, interpretable, and scalable AI support for diagnosis.
